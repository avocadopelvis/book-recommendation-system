# Book Recommendation System

On the Internet, where the number of expanding choices is overwhelming, there is an evident need to filter, prioritize and efficiently deliver relevant information in order to alleviate the problem of information overload, which has created a potential problem to many Internet users. Recommendation systems solve this problem by searching through large volumes of dynamically generated information to provide users with personalized content and services. For instance, the online retailer Amazon had a heavy hand in developing collaborative filtering algorithms that recommend items to
users. Music services like Pandora identify up to 450 uniquely identifying characteristics of songs to find music similar to that of their usersâ€™ preferences. Other music streaming services, such as Spotify, heavily rely upon the music selections of similar users to make weekly song recommendations and personalized radio stations. Netflix, a popular television and movie streaming service, uses these systems to recommend movies/shows that viewers may enjoy. This project presents a book recommendation system based on popularity, correlation and collaborative filtering.
